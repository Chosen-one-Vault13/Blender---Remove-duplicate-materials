# Blender-Remove-duplicate-materials
Remap materials with duplicates ending in .001,.002 etc. and purges the duplicated materials
Once you install the add-on you can find the command via search menu, look for "Remove Duplicate Materials". It should then automatically remap all the duplicated materials (provided the duplicates are named like <materialname>.0xx) and then purge the unused materials.
